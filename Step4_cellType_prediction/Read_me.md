# Predict cell types in Tomato

## Introduction:
Use Arabidopsis as a reference species to predict cell type in unlabeled cluters of tomato, then compare the predicted labels and the published labels to evaluate the result.

## Input data:
Marker genes in the Data folder and (Orthogroups_091023_cleaned.tsv) output file from step 2.

## Code:
Detailed code is in the Predict_Tomato_root.Rmd and Predict_Tomato_root.Rmd to predict Tomato root and shoot cell types.

## Cell type comparison across 15 plant species:
This script maps cell types of 268 cell type clusters in 15 diverse plant species together.
